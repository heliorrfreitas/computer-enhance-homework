Repo to keep the code I build for the homework of the performance aware series

The files listing_0037_single_register_mov listing_0038_many_register_mov were provided by the instructor and serve as the entry point for the decoding.c program.

To compile the code run the following: 
```
gcc decoding.c -o executable
```

To run the program run the following:

```
./executable listing_0037_single_register_mov listing_0038_many_register_mov
```
